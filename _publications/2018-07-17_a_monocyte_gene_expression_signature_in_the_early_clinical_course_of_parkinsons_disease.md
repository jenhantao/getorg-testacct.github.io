## Abstract
Microglia are the main immune cells of the brain and express a large genetic pattern of genes linked to Parkinson’s disease risk alleles. Monocytes like microglia are myeloid-lineage cells, raising the questions of the extent to which they share gene expression with microglia and whether they are already altered early in the clinical course of the disease. To decipher a monocytic gene expression signature in Parkinson's disease, we performed RNA-seq and applied the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to identify differentially expressed genes between controls and patients with Parkinson's disease and changes in gene expression variability and dysregulation. The gene expression profiles of normal human monocytes and microglia showed a plethora of differentially expressed genes. Additionally, we identified a distinct gene expression pattern of monocytes isolated from Parkinson's disease patients at an early disease stage compared to controls using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Differentially expressed genes included genes involved in immune activation such as HLA-DQB1, MYD88, REL, and TNF-a. Our data suggest that future studies of distinct leukocyte subsets are warranted to identify possible surrogate biomarkers and may lead to the identification of novel interventions early in the disease course.
