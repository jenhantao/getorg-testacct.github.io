I am a fifth year Ph.D. student at UC San Diego. I believe that our genomes encode key determinants for our health in an unknown language. My research focuses on machine learning techniques for decrypting the genome, and using this understanding to build predictive models for the behavior of the innate immune system. My thesis work has been supervised by Dr. Christopher Glass and Dr. Christopher Benner.
