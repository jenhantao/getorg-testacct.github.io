The human genome encodes key determinants for our health in a language that balances a simple alphabet of ACGTs and sophisticated grammar rules that allow for cell type and context specific gene expression. My research focuses on training machine learning models to learn to read the genome and then interrogating the inner workings of these models to advance our understanding of the how the genome is interpreted. 

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Bioinformatics program at UC San Diego.My thesis work has been supervised by Dr. Christopher Glass and Dr. Christopher Benner.
